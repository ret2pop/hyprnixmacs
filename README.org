* Introduction
HyprNixMacs is a configuration that centers around the usage of NixOS and Emacs.
Note that at the time of writing, I use hyprland as my window manager, but that
might change, and therefore hyprnixmacs may not be as accurate of a name.

** Why Not EXWM?
Because emacs is blocking, and I want to use wayland because it's much better and there's
much less cruft.

* Installation
Simply clone this repository to ~/etc/nixos/~ and run ~sudo nixos-rebuild switch~.
